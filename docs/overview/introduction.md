# Authentication Module

## Overview
The Authentication Module provides a secure and scalable solution for managing user authentication in web applications. It combines modern security practices like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with flexible token-based authentication.

## Key Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure endpoints for user onboarding and authentication.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance account security with TOTP-based MFA.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens for session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define and enforce user roles for restricted access.
- **Token Refresh**: Seamless renewal of access tokens using refresh tokens.
- **Logout**: Secure token invalidation for user sessions.

## Use Cases
- **Web Applications**: Add secure authentication to any React, Angular, or Vue app.
- **APIs**: Protect API endpoints with token-based authentication and RBAC.
- **Enterprise Systems**: Enforce strong security practices with MFA and granular access control.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Designed for small to enterprise-scale applications.
- **Security**: Follows industry best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate with additional services like Google OAuth, SMS-based MFA, or hardware tokens.
